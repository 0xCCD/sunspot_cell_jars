h1. Sunspot Cell Jars

h2. Introduction

This happy little gem will install the jars that you need for
the very wonderful sunspot_cell project found here on github.

h2. Installation

First, make sure that you have `sunspot_solr` installed and in
your Gemfile.

In your Gemfile add:

gem 'sunspot_cell_jars', :git => 'https://github.com/mrcsparker/sunspot_cell_jars.git' 

Do a `bundle install`

and then run:

rails g sunspot_cell_jars:install

and you are on your way!

Note: this gem does not actually configure sunspot_cell, it just installs the jars
needed to make extaction work.

h2. Contributing

Fork on GitHub and after you've committed tested patches, send a pull request.
