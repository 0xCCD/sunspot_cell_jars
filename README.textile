h1. Sunspot Cell Jars

h2. Introduction

This happy little gem will install the jars that you need for
the very wonderful sunspot_cell project found here on github.

h2. Before you install

These jars might give you trouble on the current version of sunspot_solr (though I have not checked).
You might want to use my updated fork, which uses solr 3.5:

https://github.com/mrcsparker/sunspot

<pre>
# If you want to load it for test and development
group :test, :development do 
  gem 'sunspot_solr', :git => "https://github.com/mrcsparker/sunspot.git"
end
</pre>

Also, you are going to want to use a version of `sunspot_cell` that is up to date with the
newest 1.3.x release.  I am using:

https://github.com/zheileman/sunspot_cell

h2. Installation

First, make sure that you have `sunspot_solr` installed and in
your Gemfile.

In your Gemfile add:

<pre>
gem 'sunspot_cell_jars', :git => 'https://github.com/mrcsparker/sunspot_cell_jars.git' 
</pre>

Do a `bundle install`

and then run:

<pre>
rails g sunspot_cell_jars:install
</pre>

and you are on your way!

Note: this gem does not actually configure sunspot_cell, it just installs the jars
needed to make extaction work.
